## Documentation ðŸ“ƒ

## `recursiveEntries()`

This function takes any plain JavaScript object and returns an array of length-2 arrays where the first item is an array of keys leading to the value and the second item is the value found at the end of the path.

```js
const obj =
  { path: { to: { a: "value" } } };
console.log(recursiveEntries(obj));
```

The above code should output the following result:

```ssh
[ ["path", "to", "a"], "value" ]
```
  
## `valueFromPath()`

This function takes any plain JavaScript object and returns the value located at a given path.

```js
const obj =
  { path: { to: { a: "value" } } };
const path = ["path", "to", "a"];
console.log(valueFromPath(obj, path));
```

The above code should output the following result:

```sh
"value"
```
